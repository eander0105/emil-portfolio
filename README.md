# My personal selfhosted website

## The idea

The idea of this project is to have a site where I can showcase my projects and blog posts.

Also to expermiment with self hosting a website at home on a raspberry pi (to begin with).

### Website (emilandersson.se)

The website will be hosted at [emilandersson.se](https://emilandersson.se/)

This is a place for me to post blog posts and share my projects, high and low. Also to have a place to put my CV.

### Rest API (emilandersson.se/api)

This was an idea of mine, to have a rest api for my CV. Where my CV can be shown in a JSON RESTful format.

It might not be very useful for reading, but I find it fairly fun to experiment with. =)


## The stack

The site is built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Also theres a backend service written in [Go](https://go.dev/) that handles the database and my restful CV.
